### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have always been enthusiastic about new technologies, ideas, and opportunities to learn and build, therefore that brings a
bright goal for me to keep me focused on this approach to become a software engineer in the future which got me to learn soft
skills such as teamwork, communication, negotiation and hard skills such as algorithm and data structure, clean code, design
patterns, and tests. The trust that I have gotten in different companies helped to take the responsibility to solve the problems
of projects.
